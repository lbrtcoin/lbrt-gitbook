# FAQ

## **Questions about** AlbertCoin (LBRT)

### **What is AlbertCoin (LBRT) and what makes it different?**

**AlbertCoin** (LBRT) is a new token and soon a platform built on Solana where users can create a dedicated environment for their needs.&#x20;

Families will have one or more Managers (parents) who will have the right to request more liquidity (LBRT) and users (children) who will have the power to trade the liquidity back and forth to the managers.

A similar system will be available for schools where the Managers (teachers) will distribute the liquidity based on pre-agreed norms, and the users (pupils) will earn the coins. They will then be able to use it within the school system or within their family system that has adopted it.

### **Why build on Solana?**

Solana stands out in DeFi with lightning-fast speeds of up to 65,000 transactions per second, 400ms block times, and less than $0.01 average transaction fees. AlbertCoin believes in the Solana vision and that it will power the future of De-Fi. Read more [here](https://medium.com/solana-labs/why-solana-8c927d58ba06).&#x20;
